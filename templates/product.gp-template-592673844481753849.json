        "ggMJPvfah5s_text": "<p><span style=\"font-size:10px;\">Sophora flavescens is a traditional medicinal plant rich in alkaloids such as oxymatrine and matrine. </span><span style=\"background-color:#B8D8FF;font-size:10px;\">Studies have demonstrated that these compounds possess both antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects. </span><span style=\"font-size:10px;\">In Malassezia biofilm assays, oxymatrine significantly inhibited biofilm biomass and reduced fungal adhesion. In dermatitis animal models, Sophora flavescens extracts suppressed TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB activation, leading to reduced cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and improved epidermal structure. These dual actions—direct antifungal effects and inflammation suppression—make it a promising botanical candidate for managing conditions like seborrheic dermatitis.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:10px;\">If you want, I can now do Artemisia Extract in this same Maca Powder format so you’ll have your top two antifungal actives ready in matching style.</span></p>",
